Space Shooter Prototype(so far)
Name ideas: Jupiter Scope, Neptune Wing
Classic space shooter with gimmicks, still thinking and will update as time goes on
Good/Evil meter/levels?
different bosses based on morality?
Weapon Crafting system: In between levels combine items for different bizarre upgrades, also add currency.
Not too much story but not too little.
